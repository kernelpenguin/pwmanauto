> This project aims to automate the importation from the big techs password managers to Proton Pass.

## Backgroud
As I grew up in front of a PC screen (26yo), I have had a lot of accounts for different purposes. A sort of shit might happen in digital life, such as losing an authentication method. Have you already been stolen and faced many problems because of your new phone number? This kind of event are pure waste of time. So, I decided to centralize everything into a secure pass manager, but importing a lot of .csv is boring. To mitigate the laziness of doing it manually, I'll create a way to automatize this task. 

### Who am I?
My name is Luiz, I'm studying Economics and going deeper into networking and cybersecurity. I started coding because an excellent professional started tutoring me for free. Even though we've started with Python, I found myself in Java, a language that I kindly refer to as "autistically perfect".

Regarding this journey, nowadays I'm very slow at Python.

# TODO
 - Export each browser's saved passwords.
 - Consolidate the exported files
- Import the consolidated file into Proton Password Manager.
